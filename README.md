# Clustering Spotify Songs by Mood

In this notebook, I used unsupervised learning techniques to analyze a generic Spotify songs dataset. By applying clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN, I was able to group songs based on their audio features. The goal is to discover patterns and classify songs into categories such as "chill", "happy", "sad", "relaxed", or "introspective".
